In the next section, that is Section A2.3, we will discuss some simple models.

In Section A2.4, we will discuss the overall process of modelling, its advantages and some of its limitations.

## A2.2 Review of Word Problems

In this section, we will discuss some word problems that are similar to the ones that you have solved in your earlier classes. Let us start with a problem on direct variation.

### Example 1 

I travelled 432 kilometres on 48 litres of petrol in my car. I have to go by my car to a place which is 180 km away. How much petrol do I need?

#### Solution

We will list the steps involved in solving the problem.

#### Step 1: Formulation 

You know that the farther we travel, the more petrol we require, that is, the amount of petrol we need varies directly with the distance we travel.

- Petrol needed for travelling 432 km = 48 litres
- Petrol needed for travelling 180 km = ?

**Mathematical Description:** Let

- \( x \) = distance I travel
- \( y \) = petrol I need

\( y \) varies directly with \( x \).

So, 

\[
y = kx
\]

where \( k \) is a constant.

I can travel 432 kilometres with 48 litres of petrol.

So, 

\[
y = 48, x = 432
\]

Therefore, 

\[
k = \frac{48}{432} = \frac{1}{9}
\]

Since 

\[
y = kx
\]

therefore, 

\[
y = \frac{1}{9} x  \quad (1)
\]

Equation or Formula (1) describes the relationship between the petrol needed and the distance travelled.

#### Step 2: Solution

We want to find the petrol we need to travel 180 kilometres; so, we have to find the value of \( y \) when \( x = 180 \). Putting \( x = 180 \) in (1), we have...
